## Analysis direction
In this case, I will focus only on Vietnam, including the following insights:
* Visualize the distribution of clan points and member levels to identify high-performing clans.
* Analyze war statistics to find the most successful clans in terms of win streaks, war wins, and ties.
* Identify the most and least family-friendly clans based on the provided flag.
* Determine the percentage of clans that focus on the Builder Base or Clan Capital.

## Analysis
### 1. Which are the top 20 countries that play Clash of Clans the most?
* Although Vietnam is currently "banned" by Supercell, it still ranks in the top 20 countries playing Clash of Clans the most. The main reason is that the majority of Vietnam's population is young, and Vietnamese people still prefer games that are simple yet strategic games.

### 2. Family Friendly in Vietnam
* Most of the Clash of Clans community in Vietnam does not enable the "Family Friendly" mode. The reason is that the majority of younger players in Vietnam tend to dislike games with a more "individual" feel, preferring action-packed, team-oriented games. Additionally, many Vietnamese people are not yet fully aware of the importance of monitoring children's exposure to online games. As a result, clans do not often feel the need to activate this mode.
